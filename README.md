# intra-slack-hubot

### Configuration

This hubot uses the following environment variables:

  - `HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN`- this is the API token for the Slack user you would like to run Hubot under.
  - `PROXY` - this is proxy server to access to internet. ex) `https://localhost:8080`

### Running

    % bin/hubot

### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

### hubot-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead
of writing it yourself, you can check
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] for existing scripts.

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.

### external-scripts

Hubot is able to load scripts from third-party `npm` package. Check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`
2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed
3. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.

##  Persistence

If you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package
(strongly suggested), you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified
account or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually
set the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.

    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL="..."

If you don't require any persistence feel free to remove the
`hubot-redis-brain` from `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry
about redis at all.
